### **1. Hybrid MCTS and Deep RL**

#### **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**:
- **Strengths**: 
  - Handles high **branching factors** (many possible moves) by strategically exploring the most promising paths via **simulations**.
  - Balances **exploration** (trying new moves) and **exploitation** (refining known good paths).
  - Works well in adversarial games with **imperfect information**, though Fenix likely has perfect information.
- **Weakness**: Pure MCTS can be computationally expensive if the search space is enormous or if the evaluation of positions is slow.

#### **Deep Reinforcement Learning**:
- **Strengths**:
  - Learns **policy** (probability distribution over moves) and **value** (estimated win probability) directly from self-play.
  - Discovers unconventional strategies by iterating over millions of games.
  - Generalizes well using neural networks to compress knowledge into weights.
- **Weakness**: Requires significant computational resources for training.

#### **Hybrid Approach**:
- Use **MCTS guided by a neural network** to focus simulations on high-value moves predicted by the network.
- The neural network (**policy-value network**) is trained via **self-play RL**:
  1. **Input**: Board state (e.g., 8x8 grid + channels for piece types).
  2. **Policy Head**: Predicts the best move probabilities.
  3. **Value Head**: Estimates the probability of winning from the current state.
- **Training**:
  - The AI plays against itself, using MCTS to select moves.
  - The games generate training data to iteratively refine the network.
  - Over time, the network becomes adept at evaluating positions, reducing reliance on brute-force search.
  - Properly balancing exploration (MCTS) with exploitation (RL policy)

#### **Neural Network Architecture**:
- Use a **ResNet-like CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network) to process spatial patterns in chess/draughts.
- Add **attention mechanisms** or **transformer layers** if long-range dependencies (e.g., coordination between distant pieces) are critical.

#### **Game-Specific Rules**:
- Handle unique rules (e.g., piece promotions, forced captures in draughts) via **masked actions** in the policy head to avoid illegal moves.

#### **Hybrid Evaluation**:
- Combine chess-centric features (e.g., material balance, king safety) and draughts tactics (e.g., king promotions, forced jumps) in the value network or reward function.

### **4. Optimizations for Efficiency**
- **Parallel Simulations**: Distribute MCTS rollouts across GPUs/TPUs.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller, faster networks for deployment.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simplified versions of Fenix (fewer pieces) and scale up complexity.
- **Optimize** MCTS for GPU. If needed, renting powerful servers is a good solution.
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch** are coded in C++ and optimized.

### **5. Evaluation and Improvement**
- **Arena Mode**: Continuously pit the latest AI against older versions and existing bots to test progress.
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Use techniques like **Domain Randomization** to ensure robustness against novel strategies.
- Start withs a **minimal viable product** and incremently add hybrid rules

### **6. Alternatives and Fallbacks**
If computational resources are limited:
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** with a **handcrafted evaluation function** could work but risks being outclassed by learning-based AIs.
- **Traditional MCTS** with domain-specific enhancements (e.g., domain knowledge in node selection).
